# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The URL Manager is a comprehensive web application built with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript that enables users to efficiently manage, edit, filter, and process large collections of URLs. The application features a dual-pane interface with advanced URL manipulation capabilities, real-time preview functionality, and sophisticated filtering options to handle various URL management tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input URLs in a text area and see processed results in another text area, so that I can efficiently manage large collections of URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display two large text areas positioned at the bottom of the screen
2. WHEN a user inputs text in the left text area THEN the system SHALL treat each line as a separate URL
3. WHEN processing is triggered THEN the system SHALL display results in the right text area
4. WHEN the input contains more than 1000 lines THEN the system SHALL show only the first 1000 lines in preview mode by default
5. WHEN the "Process All Text" checkbox is checked THEN the system SHALL process the entire input regardless of line count

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove URL parameters from my URLs, so that I can clean up URLs by keeping only the base path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Remove Parameters" operation is selected THEN the system SHALL remove all query parameters from URLs
2. WHEN processing a URL like "example.com/file.ext?v=1&v2=3" THEN the system SHALL return "example.com/file.ext"
3. WHEN a URL has no parameters THEN the system SHALL leave it unchanged
4. WHEN a URL has fragments (#) THEN the system SHALL preserve the base URL and remove parameters but keep fragments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to deduplicate URLs by different criteria, so that I can remove redundant entries based on my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Deduplicate by Top Level Domain" is selected THEN the system SHALL keep only one URL per TLD (.com, .org, etc.)
2. WHEN "Deduplicate by Domain and Subdomain" is selected THEN the system SHALL keep only one URL per full domain (including subdomains)
3. WHEN "Deduplicate by Full URL" is selected THEN the system SHALL remove exact duplicate URLs
4. WHEN deduplicating THEN the system SHALL preserve the first occurrence of each unique item
5. WHEN deduplicating THEN the system SHALL maintain the original order of remaining URLs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter URLs by including or excluding specific strings, so that I can focus on relevant URLs for my task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Filter - Remove URLs containing string" is selected THEN the system SHALL remove all URLs that contain the specified string
2. WHEN "Filter - Keep only URLs containing string" is selected THEN the system SHALL keep only URLs that contain the specified string
3. WHEN a filter string is provided THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive matching
4. WHEN no filter string is provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN filtering THEN the system SHALL preserve the original order of remaining URLs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter URLs to keep only those with top-level domains without subdomains, so that I can focus on main domain URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Keep only TLD without subdomain" is selected THEN the system SHALL keep only URLs with domains that have no subdomains
2. WHEN processing "example.com/path" THEN the system SHALL keep it (no subdomain)
3. WHEN processing "sub.example.com/path" THEN the system SHALL remove it (has subdomain)
4. WHEN processing "www.example.com/path" THEN the system SHALL remove it (www is considered a subdomain)
5. WHEN a URL is malformed THEN the system SHALL skip it and continue processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface with clear visual hierarchy and smooth interactions, so that I can efficiently perform URL management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a centered control panel with operation selection and action button
2. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through transitions
3. WHEN operations are processing THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. WHEN an operation completes THEN the system SHALL update the results with smooth animations
5. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL follow design principles of hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time statistics and feedback about my URL processing, so that I can understand the impact of operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN URLs are loaded THEN the system SHALL display the total count of input URLs
2. WHEN an operation is performed THEN the system SHALL show the count of resulting URLs
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display the number of URLs removed or modified
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN the preview mode is active THEN the system SHALL indicate that only a subset is being shown

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced URL manipulation features, so that I can perform complex URL management tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting operations THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown menu with all available operations
2. WHEN an operation requires additional input THEN the system SHALL show relevant input fields
3. WHEN processing URLs THEN the system SHALL handle various URL formats (http, https, ftp, relative paths)
4. WHEN invalid URLs are encountered THEN the system SHALL skip them and report the count
5. WHEN operations are chained THEN the system SHALL allow multiple operations to be applied sequentially

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to copy results and manage my workflow efficiently, so that I can integrate the tool into my existing processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Copy Results" button
2. WHEN the copy button is clicked THEN the system SHALL copy all results to the clipboard
3. WHEN copying is successful THEN the system SHALL show confirmation feedback
4. WHEN the text areas are focused THEN the system SHALL support standard keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
5. WHEN clearing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear buttons for both text areas

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be performant on desktop, so that I can work with large datasets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use web workers for heavy operations to prevent UI blocking
2. WHEN the window is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain proper desktop layout proportions
3. WHEN processing more than 10,000 URLs THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement efficient processing strategies
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL be optimized for desktop screen sizes (1024px and above)
