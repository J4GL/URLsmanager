## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- No server or installation required - runs entirely in the browser

### Usage

1. **Open the Application**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve the files from a local web server

2. **Input URLs**
   - Paste or type URLs into the left textarea (one per line)
   - Use the "Paste" button for clipboard content

3. **Select Operation**
   - Choose from the dropdown menu in the center panel
   - Some operations require additional filter text

4. **Process URLs**
   - Click "Process URLs" or press Ctrl+Enter
   - Watch the progress bar for large datasets

5. **Get Results**
   - Processed URLs appear in the right textarea
   - Use "Copy Results" or Ctrl+C to copy to clipboard

### Example Operations

**Remove Parameters:**
```
Input:  https://example.com/page?utm_source=google&ref=123
Output: https://example.com/page
```

**Deduplicate by Domain:**
```
Input:  https://example.com/page1
        https://example.com/page2
        https://sub.example.com/page3
Output: https://example.com/page1
        https://sub.example.com/page3
```

**Filter - Keep URLs containing "api":**
```
Input:  https://example.com/api/users
        https://example.com/about
        https://api.service.com/data
Output: https://example.com/api/users
        https://api.service.com/data
```

## Architecture
